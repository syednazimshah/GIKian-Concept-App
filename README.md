# GIKian Concept App
 The GIKian concept app was a summer project aimed at helping giki students through their daily life in GIK Institute. The main goal of the project was to digitize the current on campus restaurant ordering system (based on texting), and bring it on internet. On this app the students can view daily, menu, order food, track its prepraration status and its location while delivering. The app also gives the option to create a custom order and cancel the order.
 The app also has the feature to order groceries from on-campus stores, and offers all the features of Restaurant submenu.
 The app also has the feature of carpooling, where students can offer a ride and take a ride. In both of these options, the students can choose the time, location, gender, and number of seats to offer or share. The app updates the remaining seats automatically once a ride is booked. On the listed rides, the information of the person offering the ride is also shown, along with car information, available seats, time, and location.
 Another app was also developed for the restaurant and shop owners to track the order placed for their shops. This is where shop owners can register their shops, add items to their shop, recieve orders and update their progess.
